About |product name|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| enables customers to link their corporate identity
systems to Rackspace to let their employees use their regular company credentials to
authenticate to Rackspace accounts.  Authentication occurs using the
industry standard `SAML <http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html>`_ protocol. 

|product name| is supported for users of Rackspace Cloud, Fanatical Support for AWS, and
Managed Google Cloud Platform (XX CHANGE GCP NAME BEFORE PUBLISH XX). Dedicated Hosting accounts are not currently supported.


Benefits to using |product name| include:

- Customers can control their account security policies using existing systems
- Less need to manually create new users in the Rackspace portal
- Attribute Mapping (LINK TO AM GUIDE NOT REFERENCE) allows dynamic privileges assignments based on user attributes provided during the login process
